# AI-Powered Real-Time Hand Gesture and Sign Language Detection System

## Information Gathered
- No existing implementation for gesture detection, sign language classification, or TTS integration in the current codebase.
- Project requires building backend modules for gesture detection and classification using MediaPipe Hands or YOLOv8.
- Sign language classification model training using CNN/LSTM/Transformer on public datasets.
- Real-time inference server to process webcam input and classify gestures.
- TTS integration for converting classified text to audible speech.
- Next.js frontend dashboard for real-time display of detected signs, audio playback, and history log.
- API connection between frontend and backend for real-time feedback loop.
- Optional hardware integration for future enhancement.

## Detailed Plan

### Backend (Python)
- `backend/gesture_detection.py`
  - Implement real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe Hands or YOLOv8.
- `backend/model_training.py`
  - Scripts to train sign language classification models on datasets (ASL Alphabet, etc.).
- `backend/inference_server.py`
  - Flask or FastAPI server to handle real-time video input, run detection and classification, and return results.
- `backend/tts_integration.py`
  - Integrate Google TTS or pyttsx3 to convert classified text to speech.
- `backend/utils.py`
  - Utility functions for preprocessing, postprocessing, and logging.

### Frontend (Next.js)
- `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Main dashboard page showing real-time video feed, detected sign, audio playback controls, and history log.
- `src/components/VideoFeed.tsx`
  - Component to capture webcam video and send frames to backend API.
- `src/components/DetectedSign.tsx`
  - Display the current detected sign and its classification confidence.
- `src/components/HistoryLog.tsx`
  - Show a scrollable list of detected signs with timestamps.
- `src/lib/api.ts`
  - API client to communicate with backend inference server.

### Integration
- WebSocket or REST API for real-time communication between frontend and backend.
- Ensure minimal latency (<1s) for real-time feedback.
- Audio playback triggered on frontend upon receiving classification result.

## Dependencies
- Python: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Flask/FastAPI, pyttsx3 or Google TTS API.
- Node.js: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Follow-up Steps
- Setup Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
- Download or prepare datasets for model training.
- Train and validate classification models.
- Develop and test real-time inference server.
- Build and test frontend dashboard.
- Integrate frontend and backend with real-time communication.
- Optimize for latency and accuracy.
- Prepare deployment scripts and documentation.
